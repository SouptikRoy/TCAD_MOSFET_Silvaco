## Overview

This project provides a step-by-step guide and example input files for simulating silicon MOSFET devices. The workflow covers process simulation, device simulation, and graphical analysis of doping and material profiles.

## Features

- MOSFET process simulation (ATHENA)
- Device electrical simulation (ATLAS)
- Visualization with TonyPlot
- Layer and doping profile analysis
- Example screenshots of output plots

## Requirements

- **Silvaco TCAD Suite** (ATHENA, ATLAS, TonyPlot)
- A licensed installation of Silvaco software (not included)
- Windows or Linux environment (tested on Windows 10)
- Example `.inp` and `.str` files from this repository
